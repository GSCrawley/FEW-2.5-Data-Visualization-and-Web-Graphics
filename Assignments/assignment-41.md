# FEW 2.5 Visualization 5

Visualization with D3.

Your goal is to create a data visualization using D3. You should choose your won data set for this project. 

Browse https://www.kaggle.com for datasets. Look at the values provided by each dataset your are interested in and ask yourself how you plan to display those values visually. 

To get an idea of what is possible lookat the examples on the D3 home page [here](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). Choose one of these examples and recreate it with a different dataset.

Add to your visualization to your GitHub pages.

**Stretch Challenges:**

- Use D3's scale methods to scale and normalize data. Look at scaleOrdinal and try and make use of it in this visualization.
- Use maps in your D3 visualization
