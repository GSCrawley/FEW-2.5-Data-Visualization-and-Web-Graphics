# FEW 2.5 Visualization 5

**Due Date:** Wednesday, 3/4, 9:30am

Visualization with D3.

Your goal is to create a data visualization using D3. D3 has a steep learning curve and many features which make it a little overwhelming to get started with. Don't worry about this.

Start with a one of the example on the D3 page [here](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). Choose one of these examples and recreate it with a different dataset.

Add to your visualization to your GitHub pages.

**Stretch Challenges:**

- Use D3's scale methods to scale and normalize data. Look at scaleOrdinal and try and make use of it in this visualization.
- Use maps in your D3 visualization

| Expectation | Doe not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------------|:------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
| Aesthetics    | Uses few styles. Like background color and width or height | Uses a range of colors, adds radius and other styles | Uses a wide range of styles. Uses interesting shapes|
| Depth        | Displays 2 values from the dataset | Displays 3 or 4 data points | Displays 5 or more data points |
| Code quality | There is code... | Code uses functions and is well organized | Code makes use of functions to minimize redundancy |
| Completion  | Seems incomplete, missing features from the description, is not on GitHub pages | Is on Github pages, has all feature from the homework description | Includes new features and expands on the homework description |
