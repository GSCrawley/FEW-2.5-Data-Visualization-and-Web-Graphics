# FEW 2.5 Visualization 3

## Sorting and filtering data

**Due Date:** Mon, February 3

The goal of this assignment is to sort and filter data. 

Use the Titanic dataset.

In the last assignment you displayed all passengers in each of your visualizations. In this assignment you will sort and filter your data. 

## Challenges 

**Challenge sorting data**: Sort the data in the Titanic dataset. Try the following challenegs: 

- sort passengers by fare
- sort passengers by age
- sort passenges by gender (sex)

Apply this sorting your existing data visualizations. 

**Challenge filtering data**: Filter data on one or more data point. Try these challenges: 

- Show only the passengers who survived
- Show only the passengers who died
- Show only male passengers
- Show only female passengers
- Show only surviving male passengers
- Show only surviving female passengers

### Evaluate your work

Add three more visualizations to your Titanic project. There should be three from the previousd assignment. Add three more that show sorting and filtering of the data. 

Include all of your code in a GitHub Repo.

Create a GitHub Page that displays your work live.

The goal is to turn numbers into shapes and colors.
